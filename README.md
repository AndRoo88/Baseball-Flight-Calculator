# Baseball-Flight-Calculator
Open Source Baseball Flight Simulator using RK4 numerical integration method. This project is designed to be modifiable and improvable see: https://baseballaero.com/UMBA

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
This is a python code. you will need python installed as well as the numpy and matplotlib.pyplot libraries installed I have found https://www.codecademy.com/articles/install-python as a useful link. Additionally, you can run the code from an ide like spyder. Spyder (via anaconda) has the libraries pre-installed.https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

Once python and the requisite libraries are installed you can run the code.

x(in ft) y(in ft) z(in ft) vTot(mph) Theta(deg) Psi(deg) SpinRate(rpm) tilt(deg) gyro(deg)

x is the location left of the
